# Iris_KMeans

#  IRIS_KMeans.ipynb

Objective: This notebook demonstrates the K-Means clustering algorithm by applying it to the famous Iris dataset. The goal is to group the Iris flowers into clusters based on their physical characteristics.
Libraries Used:
pandas and numpy: For data handling.
matplotlib and seaborn: For plotting and visualization.
sklearn.cluster.KMeans: The K-Means clustering algorithm.
sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler: For scaling data (though not always strictly necessary for K-Means, it can be beneficial).
sklearn.metrics.silhouette_score: A metric to evaluate the quality of clustering.
Key Steps:
Data Loading:
Loads the Iris dataset from a CSV file.
The Iris dataset contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for different species of Iris flowers.
Data Exploration:
Prints information about the dataset (data types, number of entries, etc.).
Displays the first few rows to get a preview of the data.
May include visualizations to understand the relationships between features (e.g., scatter plots).
K-Means Clustering:
Creates a KMeans object.
Sets the n_clusters parameter, which specifies the number of clusters to form (in the Iris dataset's case, it's often 3, corresponding to the 3 Iris species).
Trains the K-Means model using the feature data (fit method). K-Means works by iteratively assigning data points to the nearest cluster centroid and updating the centroids based on the mean of the points in each cluster. Â  
Cluster Assignment:
K-Means assigns each data point to one of the clusters. These cluster assignments are typically stored as labels.
Cluster Evaluation (Potentially):
Uses the silhouette score to measure how well-separated the clusters are.
Visualizes the clusters (e.g., plotting the data points with different colors for each cluster).
Cluster Analysis:
Examines the characteristics of each cluster. This might involve:
Calculating the mean or median values of the features within each cluster.
Determining which Iris species are predominantly found in each cluster.
Key Concepts in K-Means:
Centroids: The center point of each cluster.
Distance Metric: K-Means uses a distance metric (usually Euclidean distance) to measure the similarity between data points and centroids.
Iteration: The algorithm iteratively refines the cluster assignments and centroid positions until convergence.
Choosing K: Determining the optimal number of clusters (K) is an important aspect of K-Means. Techniques like the elbow method or silhouette analysis can be used.
